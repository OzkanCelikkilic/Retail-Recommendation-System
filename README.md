This is a retail recommendation system project.
In this project, similar products to the product entered as input in the terminal are recommended based on information containing Product ID(CARIKART_ID), Product Name(MALZEME_ADI), and how much of that product was purchased(MIKTAR) in a shopping.
This information is retrieved from an Excel file that contains information about previous purchases. Unfortunately, due to privacy rules, I cannot share this Excel file.
However, I can share visualizations of a few examples that arise when the code is executed.
