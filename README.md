# Retail Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a retail recommendation system that suggests similar products based on the product entered as input in the terminal. The recommendations are made using information such as Product ID (`CARIKART_ID`), Product Name (`MALZEME_ADI`), and the quantity of the product purchased (`MIKTAR`). This data is retrieved from an Excel file containing information about previous purchases. Due to privacy rules, the Excel file cannot be shared, but visualizations of a few examples generated by the code can be provided.

## Features
- **Product Recommendations:** Suggests similar products based on the input product using historical purchase data.
- **Data Utilization:** Utilizes Product ID, Product Name, and purchase quantity to generate recommendations.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Employs cosine similarity to determine the similarity between products.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **R**

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading:** The system loads purchase data from an Excel file containing information about previous transactions.
2. **Similarity Calculation:** The cosine similarity between products is calculated based on their purchase quantities.
3. **Recommendation Generation:** Similar products to the input product are recommended based on the calculated similarities.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
